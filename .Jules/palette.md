## 2024-11-20 - Placeholder Text as a UX Pattern
**Learning:** Even with input masking, explicit placeholder text (e.g., `(555) 555-5555`) significantly reduces user hesitation by clarifying the expected format and content type immediately.
**Action:** Always include format-specific placeholders for inputs like phone numbers, SSNs, and vital signs, especially in high-stress data entry forms.

**Learning:** Fixed-height textareas in detailed narrative forms create unnecessary friction and anxiety about "hidden" content. Auto-expansion is a subtle but powerful way to encourage complete documentation.
**Action:** Use a simple JS utility to auto-expand textareas on input, respecting the initial `rows` attribute as a minimum height.
