## 2024-11-20 - Placeholder Text as a UX Pattern
**Learning:** Even with input masking, explicit placeholder text (e.g., `(555) 555-5555`) significantly reduces user hesitation by clarifying the expected format and content type immediately.
**Action:** Always include format-specific placeholders for inputs like phone numbers, SSNs, and vital signs, especially in high-stress data entry forms.
